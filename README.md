# Number Guessing Game

This is a relatively simple Python program where the user is supposed to guess a number. The program prompts the user to pick the minimum and maximum for the range of possible numbers (i.e. 1 and 100), and then generates a random number in that range. From there, the program tells the user whether their number is too high or low, and at the ending prompting them to either restart the game or end it.

## How It's Made

The whole program is written in Python as it is terminal based (for now), and uses basic logic to get the game to work. Initially, the user is prompted to enter the minimum and max for the range, and from there, the core logic runs in a while loop, checking if the user's guess is equal to the number. If it isn't they are given their higher/lower and another guess. If it is equal however, they are prompted to either restart or end the game with a (Y/N).

## Lessons Learned

As it is a pretty primitive Python program, the game allowed me to implement a lot of the skills I have learned now at the beginning of my Python journey. More so than Python experience, this program has helped me clean up my overall coding environment, from my file structure and VS Code, to figuring out how to use GitHub.
